# TECHBARN FULLSTACK VERSION ðŸ‘‹ðŸš€

- So I decided to start a new version of my BlogApp using different tech stacks.
- I will use [NextJS Typescript](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend.
- I will use [Python Django Rest Framework for the Backend](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
- As I progress, I will continue to add every tech stack/tool that I have used on this project.
